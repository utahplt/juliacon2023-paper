* Intro: the busy scientist
* Floating-point review
** Brief refresher for mostly Julia-focused people
 - Floating-point is an approximation of the reals—the gaps introduce error
 - Exceptional values are useful annoyances
   + Helpful to see when something has gone wrong, but annoying because they ruin our calculations
   + Can be mitigated by tweaking our arithmetic (if someone hasn't done this before, I think this will be eye-opening)
 - It can be hard to track down where these things come from—that's what we help with
** How we characterize floating-point events
 - gen, prop, kill, with one or two examples
* FloatTracker introduction
** Live demo of adding FloatTracker to the maximum example
Use the max example to illustrate simultaneously how a NaN kill can be dangerous and how FloatTracker helps us find the problem.
* Case Studies
** ShallowWaters
** OrdinaryDiffEq
** Finch
** RxInfer
* Making FloatTracker work
** Intercept floating-point exceptions
** Inject NaNs
** Summarize with CSTG
** Using metaprogramming
